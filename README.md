# Title_Case
This project changes the capitalization of a string to fit a desired format.    
Some of the programming concepts that I utilized include interfaces, HashSets, and accessing data from files.    
This project is still a work in progress. My goals are to finish implementing the TitleCase concrete class, clean up the code, and create a test suite.    
In the future, I may try to create a graphical interface for the program or even host the program on a website.
